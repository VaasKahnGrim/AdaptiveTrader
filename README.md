# AdaptiveTrader
A personal tool meant for handling crypto trading bots easily. Mainly switching between SHORT and LONG bots without having to manually turn one off and the other on.

I might add features over time, not 100% sure. For now its mainly meant to just turn one bot on and another bot off. It could potentially be scaled to an almost infinite number of bots depending on how you write your DecideStrategy() function.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A TRADING BOT!!!! This is nothing more than a tool for managing trading bots provided by 3Commas. It is also a WIP and primarily meant for my own personal use. It is being made public so that others can learn and so that potentially those learning may help improve it over time. I am not responsible for any bans, rate limits, money lost or other issues that arise from this tool. User discretion is advised.
